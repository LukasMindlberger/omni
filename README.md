# The Omni Project

***Decentralising scholarly communications***

</br></br>

> *Omni is in early development. Marcus is currently slamming through web development courses so we can deliver a proof of concept as soon as possible. Cameron is hustling for funding support and potential partnerships. If you're interested in helping, even to just give advice, please let us know.*

At *The Omni Project*, we’re helping build the next generation of scholarly communications. The academic publishing system is deeply broken — the dissemination of research has become tightly intertwined with the commercial interests of publishers and the growing importance of reputation in academia.

We want to help break this industry deadlock, by disentangling research output from profit and prestige. The best way to achieve this is by giving academics the tools to collectively build an alternative model from the ground-up, which can allow a fundamentally better and more sustainable system to emerge.

Our vision for *The Omni Project* is to start bringing the world's academics closer together, leveraging the collective intelligence of academic communities, and scaling academic discussion to an unprecedented level. Afterall, this is what the Internet was originally intended for, and only then can academia re-align with its original purpose — to share new knowledge with the world.

# Introduction

The journal publication model made sense for the last few hundreds of years, but has rapidly become outdated within the new digital context. Although many journals have gone paperless, the *process* of scholarly communications has not changed—publishing and journal issuing has merely been rendered in a digital format, and publishers have not made much use of the many powerful digital features we have today.

## False scarcity

The publishing system relies on false scarcity and artificial inaccessibility to reap the profits of the priceless work of authors. Not only is this unfair for researchers but prevents plenty of valuable knowledge being shared in research ecosystems and society more generally. Open Access was a good start to helping making research accessible, but there is still a lot of potential to improve on it, and in a way that is sustainable for the research ecosystem—not the publishing giants (who, arguably, do not deserve as much money as they get). Although editing is important, the system can't only work for the editors, which is why we're taking a stand *to put researchers, institutions and citizens first*.

A lot of useful work goes unpublished (e.g. null results, replication studies, full data sets, mistakes worth learning from, simulation code, and more). With no straightforward way to share this knowledge around, this often isn't easily accessible.

## Prestige economy

The reputation of researchers in the current model is based on an overly reductive indicators of value, with the main culprit: the impact factor. The number of reads and citations of articles is [not enough to accurately represent](http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2017/03/academia-is-fucked-up-so-why-isnt.html) the value researchers contribute to the research ecosystem and/or to society. As scholarly communications is further digitised, we see an opportunity to make visible the many kinds of contributions people make to the ecosystem and, ideally, compensate them for these efforts. We need a [currency](http://www.artbrock.com/blog/designing-social-flows-chapter-6-designing-incentives) system which promotes good science and gets information to the relevant people, not a competitive model based on pumping out paper after paper.

## Impact over quality

Although the validity of research is a prerequisite for getting an article through peer-review, it is treated as binary — valid or invalid. If there's anything I've learned from studying science it's that any claim is constantly being questioned. Any model of - or conclusion about - reality is only an assertation of an individual or group at a particular point in time, and rarely something that all parties will forever agree on. In the current system, such conclusions 'become truth' due to the decision of a small number of anonymous peer-reviewers, and not by the scholarly community collectively. We're not saying that all scholars are experts in every speciality and ought to state their opinion on every article, but that any member of the scholarly community *should be able to indicate* their understanding of an article's validity/quality from their epistemological position, at a particular point in time and always able to be updated.

Distinguishing *quality* and *impact* would allow researchers to be assessed on *process*, not only on the results of their research (where, arguably, luck can play a big part). We think if researchers develop good hypotheses and follow methodologies accurately, then they deserve credit regardless of the outcome. We see this as a way to encourage replications and the sharing of null results, as well as other 'less interesting' content which are often claimed to be the cornerstone of good research but are rarely seen. A indicator of validity or quality could identify researchers who follow *good process* and could redirect some flows of funding to the people who deserve better compensation.

## Stuck in static

Articles are still mostly treated as static PDFs with the figures and tables mashed obtrusively within the text. Do you find yourself scrolling up and down pages of text to find the figure being referenced, and then losing track of what you were just reading? This is an outdated way of viewing content and the rest of the internet has come a long way to displaying content effectively. We see the opportunity to enable readers to see the content they want to see in the ways that work best for them. Digital storytelling allows for non-traditional forms of communication, which, if applied to scholarly communications, could greatly increase the comprehensibility and accessibility of research, as well as enabling dynamic and large amounts of information to be displayed and interacted with nonlinearly. Increasing our expressive capacity is core to our ability to understand each other and collectively progress. It's time we moved on from purely static content.

## Collective intelligence

We've been interested in the developments of social networking platforms and how strongly they can shape human behaviour, for good or for worse. On one side you've got the likes of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube where comments can quickly devolve into echo-chambers and polarised communities which breed outrage. On these platforms, content is often micromanaged to maximise user attention and to serve targeted advertising. On the other hand, communities like Wikipedia, Reddit, Stack Overflow and Quora (and even 4chan) are capable of aggregating high quality content and facilitating insightful and productive discussions. This shows the power our digital architectures and community spaces can have on individual and collective behaviour, and much could be learned from these to help us design systems that prioritise relevant content to users and maximise collective intelligence.

## Enclosure

The intellectual pursuit of discovery always produces tremendous value to society, yet we have let ourselves become [enclosed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure) by the publishers who tell us they are absolutely critical and we have no choice but to go through them. Research ought to be an [act of commoning](http://wealthofthecommons.org/essay/introduction-commons-transformative-vision), something that is done for the sake of collective learning, not to make a profit for publishers or enable scholars to beat their rivals. Not even [Open Access scholars have avoided enclosure](https://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/525), with [Hindawi, an Open Access publisher, having a higher profit margin (52%) than Elsevier (36%) in 2010](http://threader.ecs.soton.ac.uk/lists/boaiforum/2769.html). It's time for an alternative that resists enclosure and promotes the things scholars actually care about: humanity and good science, for a start.

# Introducing *The Omni Project*

We're not creating another repository, journal or even publisher. Omni is a *public, digital space* for academics to share their work without barriers, quickly reach their intended audiences and receive feedback from anyone in the academic community. With an open review system, and quality assurance protocols decided on by the Omni community, we see the potential for academic research and scholarly communications to improve dramatically.

> Omni is an **open source** and **distributed** web application enabling scholars to write, share, discuss and review research papers with academic communities.

We're essentially building a "scholarly commons" for more accessible, open and participatory research. The process of editing, dissemination, discussion and review can be performed by any user of Omni, which can drastically improve the flow and evolution of information, knowledge and ideas. And by rewarding those for contributing genuine value to the research process (rather than focusing solely on research outcomes) we can incentivise more valid, scientific and organic knowledge creation.

At a glance, Omni offers the following capabilities:

- Write articles using an advanced online editor, or upload your own
- Share articles with communities, get feedback and start discussions
- Discover the best, most recent and controversial papers in your field
- Review papers and help the community decide what valid research looks like
- Watch your reputation reflect the quality and consistancy of your contributions

## Decentralised Technology

Omni is governed entirely its users, meaning no single entity has control over the platform, and it uses an accountability-based system to incentivise better behaviour. As a result, the academic community can become a fully autonomous organisation, without the need for a middleman or top-down incentive structure.

> The Omni application will be hosted on a fully distributed, peer-to-peer protocol called [Holochain](http://www.holochain.org). It's a truly decentralised, democratic and secure Internet, with the capacity for large-scale social coordination.

This technology is enabling us to build Omni on a system of value creation, compensation, transparency, accountability and community engagement (principles that academia *should* be built on). In summary, Holochain can enable the following:

- Tracking and acknowledging all actions made by users
- Protecting authorship and intellectual property rights
- Rewarding anybody for creating or contributing value
- Incentivising more productive and collaborative behaviour

All data will be stored in a Holochain *Distributed Hash Table* (DHT), which is a public database not hosted by any central party, but is supported by all users of Omni using their currently unused spare computing resources (think of a decentralised AWS). And since everyone owns their own data in Omni, no one can prevent an author from sharing their research to as many communities as they wish.

## Advantages of using Holochain

We aren't the only ones in the open source community working on new tools for scholarly researchers, and neither are we the only ones aiming to decentralise the publishing system—namely, the [Aletheia](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-whitepaper/blob/master/WHITE-PAPER.md) application built on Ethereum—but we see building Omni on Holochain [as the best way](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/wiki/FAQ) to pull these efforts together into an efficient and scalable distributed application, uninhibited by the high costs and limitations of blockchain. We encourage others working on similar applications and microservices to also consider using Holochain.

The interoperability of Holochain applications means Omni can immediately benefit from the work of other open source projects. Holochain also enables the community to administrate the Omni application themselves (much more simply than Ethereum DAOs), making it the way they want it—not just how we think it should be. Again, all of these can be achieved at much lower costs than an Ethereum version of Omni would. Holochain is environmentally sustainable as no computing power is wasted on busywork. Holochain is cryptographically secure and tamper-proof, and Holochain applications can't 'go down' as long as at least one computer is running the application—the Omni archive of research will never disappear. Even if 50% of users suddenly dropped off the Omni network, all of the data would still be available.
